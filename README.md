# Prefab Fitness
The fitness use cases for [`prefab`](https://github.com/neighborhoods/prefab).

The `UseCaseXY` directories are example starting points that Prefab should be able to build from.
`X` corresponds to the major version of prefab for this use case. 
`Y` is an incrementing integer to distinguish the use cases.

Each `UseCaseXY` directory contains a specific `README.md` for that use case.

### Table of Contents

Use Case | README| Description
